    a day + season indicator
    things happening to the plants and planters

        a bunch chances, influenced by the plants and whatnot
            eg, rabbity credrs have a 20% chance of spawning in tall grass every day
                maybe internally, each day is composed of a bunch of "ticks" (like hours), so that way it isn't that everything happens all at once when the day starts
