===COMPANION PLANT===


choose 3 (??) plants per 4 (??) plant planters each ultimately capable of growing 5-9 plants

watch the interaction between plants and planters, and pests and other peripheral entities (??)
    interactions between planters?

hit space to harvest all
    does this end the game?

all harvested plants are unlocked and allow the player to plant new fun plants should they replay the game

# plants:

## starter:
grass
tall grass
beans (increases soil Nitrogen)
sunflower (increases sunlight)

## find through chance
pitcher plant (collects water, feeds MICE)
cheese plant (attracts NICE MICE)
petunia (attracts RATHER ANGRY BEES)
garlic (repels insects and vampires)
tomato (attracts DIRTY THIEVING NEIGHBORS)
bamboo (acts as a trellis for tomato plants)
bananas tree (acts as a trellis for tomato plants; grows in 60 days; allows beehives to be built when enough bees arrive; rustles strangely and randomly causes strange events. reduces sunlight when fully grown)
Genetically Modified Venus Fly Trap (eats neighbors, significantly increasing nitrogen)

## even more special:
Heirloom Variety Type of each plant. (Has a special color scheme.)
dead variety of each plant


# critters:
NICE MICE are attracted to cheese plants.
    They will search plots of nearby cheese plants first before moving on to the next one where they will increase nitrogen levels, sometime drop seeds (15%) and continue until they eat enough.
    If a whole group of NICE MICE eat enough they will live in the garden, making a routine NICE MICE interaction as well as random NICE MICE encounters.
    Interaction between NEIGHBORS and the NICE MOUSE will increase chance of dropping seeds to 90% but will also repel the mice.
RATHER ANGRY BEES will go from planter to planter, and repel from the garden NEIGHBORS who touch their home planter
DIRTY THIEVING NEIGHBORS will go from planter to planter, checking each tomato plant's tomatoes for ripeness (3 tomatoes at a time), stealing each ripe tomato, and moving on to the next planter. Will only happen if you plant on the left or right sides where the neighbors can see your tomato plants and they will not steal more than 8 in one day.
VAMPIRES are attracted to DIRTY THIEVING NEIGHBORS and drop Heirloom Variety plant seeds when they encounter one, as well as taking away one NEIGHBOR

--- seems like below are extra; don't have plant specific interactions, so they can be sort of exchaged ---

SQUIRRELY CREATURES found in trees. Eats nuts and seeds, buries them sometimes.
RABBITY CREATURES found in tall grass. Turns tall grass into short grass. Turns short grass into stubs
FISHY CREATURE found in trees
BIDOOF found in tall grass
SHINY BIDOOF same as bidoof but is shown in a different color.
GROSS FLIES are attracted to full GMO Venus Fly Traps and repel NEIGHBORS


# externalities:
sunlight
nitrogen, allows the soil to remain fertile to allow for the accumulation and growth of up to the maximum of 9 plants per planter. (otherwise it maxes out at 5)
water, required


# seasons, 365 days a year:
    spring 80
        medium sunlight; medium-high chance of rain
    summer 95
        high sunlight; high chance of rain
    autumn 80
        medium sunlight; medium chance of rain
    winter 70
        low sunlight; no rain, high chance of snow

# appearance
    how do the plants look? how do the planters look? how are they arranged in the planter?
        is it all abstract? maybe ascii animations can play when events happen, but otherwise it's abstract (like oregon trail, IIRC)
