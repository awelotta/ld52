non-starter plants:
Genetically Modified Venus Fly Trap (eats neighbors)
Heir Variety Type of each plant 

critters:
HUNGRY MICE are attracted to cheese plants. They will search plots of nearby cheese plants first before moving on to the next one where they will sometime drop seeds. Interaction between NEIGHBORS and the a HUNGRY MOUSE will increase chance of dropping seeds to 90% but will also repel the mice.

DIRTY THIEVING NEIGHBORS will go from planter to planter, checking each tomato plant's tomatoes for ripeness (3 tomatoes at a time), stealing each ripe tomato, and moving on to the next planter. Will only happen if you plant on the left or right sides where the neighbors can see your tomato plants and they will not steal more than 8 in one day.

RATHER ANGRY BEES will go from planter to planter, and repel NEIGHBORS who touch their home planter

BADGERS 

GROSS FLIES are attracted to full GMO Venus Fly Traps and repel NEIGHBORS

VAMPIRES are attracted to DIRTY THIEVING NEIGHBORS and drop Heirloom Variety plant seeds when they encounter one, as well as taking away one NEIGHBOR.
