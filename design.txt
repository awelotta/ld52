hit space to harvest all

all harvested plants are unlocked and allow the player to plant new fun plants should they replay the game



plants:
beans (increases soil Nitrogen 
sunflower
pitcher plant (collects water, feeds MICE)
flower? (attracts BEES)
cheese plant (attracts MICE (see: MICE))
tomato (attracts DIRTY THIEVING NEIGHBORS)
bamboo (acts as a trellis for tomato plants)
banana tree (acts as a trellis for tomato plants; grows in 10 months)

non-starter plants:
Genetically Modified Venus Fly Trap (eats neighbors)


critters:
MICE are attracted to cheese plants. They will search nearby cheese plants first before moving on to the next one where they will sometime drop seeds. Interaction between NEIGHBORS and the MICE will increase chance of dropping seeds to 90%. 

DIRTY THIEVING NEIGHBORS will go from planter to planter, checking each tomato plant's tomatoes for ripeness (3 tomatoes at a time), stealing each ripe tomato, and moving on to the next planter. Will only happen if you plant on the left or right sides where the neighbors can see your tomato plants and they will not steal more than 8 in one day.

PREDATORY WASPS will go from planter to planter, and repel NEIGHBORS who touch their home planter
